## About Me

I'm a software developer specializing in building amazing websites. I enjoy working with CSS and animations in my free time, and I love contributing to open source projects. My goal is to continuously learn and improve my skills while creating impactful and user-friendly web experiences.

When I'm not buried in code, I'm probably watching anime or reading web novels. These hobbies are a huge part of my life and keep me inspired and entertained.

I'm aiming to break into cyber security someday. It's a field that fascinates me and combines my love for problem-solving with a desire to make the digital world safer.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about tech, anime, web novels, or anything else. Iâ€™d love to connect!

Thanks for stopping by!
